# Design and Implementation of Mobile Applications
## PoliMi 2021-2022

Welcome to the repository for our mobile app developed as part of the DIMA (Design and Implementation of Mobile Applications) course at Politecnico di Milano. This project showcases our initial foray into mobile app development using the Dart programming language and the Flutter framework. Inside, you'll find the complete source code along with the design document detailing our app's architecture, features, and development process.

The source code contains some data that might be considered sensitive and that we carelessly committed and pushed during development back when the repository was private. The Firebase project has since been deleted.
